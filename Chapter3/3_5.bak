;Implement Monte Carlo integration as a procedure estimate-integral that takes as arguments a
;predicate P, upper and lower bounds x1, x2, y1, and y2 for the rectangle, and the number of trials to
;perform in order to produce the estimate. Your procedure should use the same monte-carlo
;procedure that was used above to estimate . 




;Use your estimate-integral to produce an
;estimate of by measuring the area of a unit circle.
